# Success Criteria

## What MVP Success Looks Like

Success for efOfX MVP is measured by **trust, accuracy, and distribution** - not vanity metrics.

### 1. Calibration Accuracy (The Core Promise)
- **70% of estimates within 20% of actual outcomes** for construction domain
- Measurable improvement in accuracy after feedback incorporation
- Track record visible to users: "Within 15% for 68% of similar pool installations"

### 2. Feedback Loop Closure (Self-Improvement)
- **40% of completed projects submit actual outcome data**
- Both customer AND contractor feedback captured for discrepancies
- System learns from every submission, visible in improved estimates
- Calibration metrics displayed per tenant: "Your estimates are trending 12% high"

### 3. Distribution Success (White Label Adoption)
- **10 contractors embed the white label chat widget** on their websites
- Widget drives at least 50 estimation requests across all installations
- Contractors report: "Customers prefer the interactive chat over static quote forms"
- Zero security incidents or cross-tenant data leakage

### 4. Multi-Tenant Operations (Business Viability)
- **15 active tenants using BYOK** for construction estimates
- Each tenant has submitted at least 5 estimates
- At least 5 tenants have closed the feedback loop (submitted outcomes)
- Synthetic data proven viable (real outcomes validate synthetic reference classes)

### 5. Trust Building (The Differentiator)
- Users choose **transparency mode** (P50/P80 ranges) over "single number" estimates
- Contractors use estimates to **educate customers**, not just quote
- Reduced estimate padding over time (measurable through feedback data)
- Customer feedback: "I understood why the range existed"

### 6. Technical Foundation (Enables Scale)
- Domain-agnostic backend proven with **2 verticals** (construction + IT/dev)
- Synthetic data generation creates viable reference classes (validated by real outcomes)
- BYOK multi-tenancy works securely with encrypted API keys
- White label widget works on contractor sites with <5 lines of JavaScript

## What MVP Does NOT Need to Achieve

- ❌ Communication coaching UI (internal/external narrative toggle - post-MVP)
- ❌ Multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI BYOK is sufficient for MVP)
- ❌ Real-time collaboration (async estimation is fine)
- ❌ Mobile apps (web-based widget + API is sufficient)
- ❌ Advanced analytics dashboard (basic calibration metrics only)

## Success Tracking

**Key Metrics Dashboard:**
- Estimation requests per tenant
- Feedback submission rate
- Calibration accuracy by reference class
- White label widget adoption rate
- Synthetic vs real data performance comparison
