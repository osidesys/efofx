# PRD Summary

## What We've Defined

efOfX Estimation Service MVP delivers an AI-powered, multi-tenant estimation platform with three breakthrough capabilities:

1. **Synthetic Data Generation** - Bootstraps the platform with realistic reference classes for construction (7 types) and IT/dev (5 types) domains without requiring extensive historical data

2. **Feedback-Driven Calibration** - Closes the learning loop with dual feedback (customer + contractor), calculates accuracy metrics, and tunes estimates based on real outcomes

3. **White Label Distribution** - Embeddable chat widget (<5 lines of code) enables contractors to offer estimation on their websites with full branding customization

## Core Requirements Count

- **Functional Requirements:** 8 major feature areas, 25 detailed requirements
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** 7 categories (performance, security, scalability, reliability, monitoring, maintainability, integration)
- **API Endpoints:** 15 endpoints across 6 categories
- **Data Models:** 5 MongoDB collections with domain-agnostic schema

## What Makes This Special

The product magic woven throughout this PRD:

**"A communication coach that happens to estimate projects"** - efOfX doesn't just predict costs, it teaches transparent communication through:
- P50/P80 distributions instead of false precision
- Visible assumptions and risks
- Calibration metrics that build trust over time
- Contractor and customer feedback reconciliation

**Trust through transparency** - The competitive moat is earned, not built:
- Self-improving estimates (feedback loop)
- Domain-agnostic architecture (proven across construction + IT)
- BYOK model respects tenant data ownership

## Success Criteria Recap

MVP succeeds when:
- ✅ **70% of estimates within 20%** of actual outcomes (construction)
- ✅ **40% feedback submission rate** (closes the loop)
- ✅ **10 contractors embed widget** (distribution)
- ✅ **15 active BYOK tenants** (business viability)
- ✅ **2 domains validated** (construction + IT/dev)
